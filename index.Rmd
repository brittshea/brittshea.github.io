I am currently a PhD student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Environmental Health Sciences Department, in the Climate and Health Program. I began my PhD in the fall of 2021. Previously, my research focused on climate and health education, childrenâ€™s environmental health, and corporate accountability and sustainability. I am interested in conducting research on the health impacts of extreme climate events, climate-health mitigation and adaptation strategies, and environmental justice.
